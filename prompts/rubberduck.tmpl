As you're typing out your code, imagine explaining it step-by-step to a rubber duck sitting on your desk. Start by describing the problem you're trying to solve, then walk through each line of code and explain what it's doing. If you get stuck, try verbalizing your thought process and reasoning out loud to the duck. By the end of the exercise, not only will you have debugged your code, but you'll have a better understanding of how it works.
